# Tabby
The idea for this application was that a traveler could explore the world lightly and keep track of their trips in an organized way. They would be able to create diary entrys, add photos, and add notes to other people trips. Instead of using seperate applications for notes, pictures, and social media, Tabby is an all in one travel journal application.
